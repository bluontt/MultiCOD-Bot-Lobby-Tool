## 🛡️ Bot Protection & Anti-Detection

This tool includes advanced protection features to help keep your bot accounts safer.

- **Input Spoofing**: Simulated keyboard and mouse inputs are sent directly to the game instances to bypass basic detection.
- **Session Isolation**: Each game view runs independently with separate sessions and browser fingerprints.
- **Hardware Fingerprint Management**: A built-in hardware ID system helps manage account sessions and security.

Getting started is simple. Follow these steps to get your bot farm up and running.

### Step 1: First-Time Launch
1.  Launch the **Multi-COD Bot Tool** application.
2.  When prompted, enter the **license key** you received.
3.  The tool will validate your license. Please wait for this process to complete.

### Step 2: Configure Your Session

1.  **Choose Your Game**: Select MW3, BO6, or BO7.
2.  **Select Game Mode**: Choose Multiplayer, Warzone, or CDL.
3.  **Set View Count**: Pick the number of game instances you want to run (1-44). If you're unsure, start with a lower number like 5-10.
4.  Click **Start**.

## 🤖 The Control Bar: Your Command Center

The control bar appears at the top of the main window and gives you access to all automation features.

### Essential Macros
- **🚶 Auto Movement**: Toggles random WASD movement to prevent the game from flagging you as AFK.
- **AFK Host / 🎮 AFK Player / 💪 AFK Both**: These are automated modes for hands-free farming.
    - **Host**: Use for the account that is hosting the lobby.
    - **Player**: Use for the bot accounts joining the lobby.
    - **Both**: A combined mode for maximum automation.
- **🎯 Auto-Join (WIP)**: This feature is designed to automate joining game lobbies. It should be used from the game's "Press any button to start" screen. Please note that this is still a Work in Progress (WIP) and its functionality may be limited or change.
- **⚡ High Quality / 🐢 Low Quality**: Instantly switches performance modes. Use Low Quality to save CPU and RAM when running many instances.

### Combat Automation
- **Aim**: Hold down the **`O`** key.
- **Fire**: Hold down the **`P`** key.
- These inputs are sent directly to the game, so they won't accidentally type in the chat. If you see chat open for any reason, simply close it in-game and the bot will continue working correctly.

### Additional Controls
- **🔗 Sync Panel**: Opens the View Synchronization window to control multiple games at once.
- **⚙️ Settings**: Access application settings and configuration.

---

## 🔗 View Synchronization

Synchronize your keyboard inputs across multiple game instances to control them simultaneously.

### How to Use the Sync Panel
1.  Click the **🔗 Sync** button on the control bar to open the panel.
2.  **Select Views to Sync**:
    - Use the quick-select buttons: `✓ Sync All`, `🤖 Bots`, `👑 Hosts`, or `✕ None`.
    - Alternatively, manually check the box for each view you want to control.
3.  Click **Apply Sync** at the bottom to confirm your selection.
4.  Any keyboard input you make will now apply to all synchronized views.
5.  To close the panel, click the `✕` in the corner or click anywhere outside of it.

*Pro-Tip: All panels (Sync, Settings, etc.) can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging their header.*

## ⚙️ Required In-Game Settings

**IMPORTANT**: For the AFK, automation, and macro features to work correctly, your in-game keybinds for each bot account **must be set to the game's default settings**.

The tool sends hard-coded keyboard and mouse inputs. If you have customized your keybinds, the bot will press the wrong keys and its actions will fail.

### How to Ensure Compatibility
1.  For each bot account, go to the in-game settings.
2.  Find the **Keyboard & Mouse** settings.
3.  Use the option to **Reset all keybinds to Default**.

This is the most common reason why AFK movements or other macros fail to work on some or all game views.

The bot uses default keys for all actions, including:
- **Movement**: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`
- **Jump/Stand**: `Space`
- **Crouch/Slide**: `C`
- **Sprint**: `Left Shift`
- **Interact**: `E`
- **Reload**: `R`
- **Melee**: `F`
- **Equipment**: `Q`, `G`
- **ADS**: `Right Mouse Button` or `O`
- **Fire Weapon**: `Left Mouse Button` or `P`

## 💡 Tips for Best Performance

### General Advice
- **Start Small**: If you're new, begin with 5-10 views to see how your system performs, then gradually increase the count.
- **Use a Wired Connection**: A stable internet connection is crucial for running multiple instances.
- **Close Other Apps**: Free up system resources (CPU, RAM) by closing unnecessary background applications.
- **Activate Low Quality Mode**: When running 10+ views, switch to **🐢 Low Quality** mode to reduce lag.

### Recommended View Counts by RAM

| Your System RAM | Recommended Max Views |
|:---------------:|:---------------------:|
| 8GB             | 5-10 views            |
| 16GB            | 10-20 views           |
| 32GB+           | 20-44 views           |

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How many game instances should I run?**
A: Start with 5-10 and increase the count if your PC can handle it. The maximum is 44.

**Q: Do I need a separate Xbox Game Pass subscription for each view?**
A: Yes. Each game instance requires its own Xbox account with an active Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass subscription.

**Q: My computer is lagging a lot. What can I do?**
A: The first step is to enable **Performance Mode** (click the `⚡` button so it changes to `🐢`). If that's not enough, reduce your view count and close other programs like Chrome, Discord, or Spotify.

**Q: Can I use my license key on more than one computer?**
A: No, each license is tied to the hardware of a single computer.

**Q: My sync panel or macros aren't working.**
A: The most common cause is that the games haven't fully loaded yet. Please wait for every instance to reach the main menu. If the issue persists, try toggling the macro or sync off and on again, or restart the application.
